\subsection*{Chapter 1}

\paragraph{? page 2, line 5--6:} What do you mean by ``some ‘mistakes’ can be beneficial, at least temporarily''?

\paragraph{? page 2, line 10--...:} There some repetitions there, maybe you want to make it bit shorter.

\paragraph{? page 3, footnote 3:} ``I am refering to'' $>\!>\!>$ ``For example,''.

\paragraph{? page 4, line 6:} ``Literature'' $>\!>\!>$ ``Library''

\subsection*{Chapter 2}

\paragraph{? page 10, Figure 2.5:} Figure  2.5 should be after Figure 2.6.

\paragraph{? page 10, line $\bm{(-14)}$--$\bm{(-13)}$:} It seems that you refer to the caption of the figure 2.5 --- the picture is not quite related. I would just copy text from the cauption and remove ref to the figure.

\paragraph{? page 11, footnote 3:} The words ``increasing kinetic energy'' might be misleading in this context --- I would say ``pumping energy into the system''.

\paragraph{? page 13, Figure 2.7:} It seems that (a) and (b) parts of the figure uppear in wrong order + there are no labels (a) and (b).

\paragraph{? page 14, Problem 2.4:} Nearly the same problem appers in Makovetsky’s book (Problem 22).

\paragraph{? page 16, line 1--2:} $G$ was defined couple of lines above.

\subsection*{Chapter 3}

\paragraph{? page 20, A culinary application of Taylor-Proudman’s theorem:} Do you have an illustrations for this part?

\paragraph{? page 21, sec 3.3 line 1:} I would move word ``Problem.'' to line 10 on the next page and  mark by ``Solution.'' the next sentence.

\paragraph{? page 22, sec 3.5 line 2:} ``sails'' is a bit strange together with ``Air resistance
is to be ignored''.

\paragraph{? page 24, Answer:} Should you make a comment that it is not always possible?

\subsection*{Chapter 4}

\paragraph{? page 29, line 10:} ``as Figure 4.1 illustrates'', but it does not illustrates.

\paragraph{? page 32, sec 4.3:} This section does not seem to belong to this chapter.

\paragraph{! page 32, sec 4.3:} In this section ``you'' switches to ``I'' --- I would write all with ``I''.

\subsection*{Chapter 5}

\paragraph{? page 39 sec 5.1 line 5:} ``nonviscous water'' --- do you want to say something about viscosity?

\paragraph{? page 41 line 7:} Remove ``and $A$ is the area of the piston’s face'' --- it is already defined and can be removed.

\paragraph{? page 41 line 10--11:} Remove ``, where $a$ is the cross-sectional area of the exit tube'' --- it is already defined and can be removed.

\paragraph{? page 41 formula (5.2):} Forgotten square and period, it should be
\[F = \frac12\rho A v^{2} \left[ \left(\frac{A}{a}\right)^2  - 1 \right].\]

\paragraph{? page 42 Figure 5.3:} I do not think it works with air --- the men is also under atmospheric pressure.

\paragraph{? page 42 sec 5.2 line 4:} ``gravity plays'' $>\!>\!>\!>$ ``gravity and viscosty play''.

\paragraph{? page 47 line 5:} ``because the arm is a semicircle'' --- I would the following:

``Indeed, the radial component of this velocity is the same as in the reference frame rotating together with the sprinkler.
And in this frame, the water jet must be directed tangentially to the tube, that is, perpendicular to the direction toward $P$; in other words, it has zero radial component.''

\paragraph{! page 47 Figure 5.9:} This figure is misleading, since the sprinkler rotates, the water will look a bit like on 5.8, if you watch it from above it should be Archimedean spiral.

\paragraph{! page 52 Figure 5.12:} The picture on the left does not agree with picture on the right --- the horisontal bar in the second ``+'' should not be that horizontal.

\paragraph{? page 53 Figure 5.14:} Add labeles (a) and (b).

\paragraph{? page 53 line $\bm{(-2)}$:} ``simple'' did you want to say that ``it has fixed velocity field''?

\paragraph{! page 54 line 3:} One the picture the fixed point is marked by $S$ and now it is $P$.

\paragraph{? page 54 line 3:} Do you want to comment on where exactly this point lies on the segment?

\paragraph{! page 54 Figure 5.15:} The droplets must have bigger diameter than the tube!

\paragraph{? page 55 Figure 5.16:} By looking at the picture one may arrive at a wrong conclusion that the front lines are straight.

\subsection*{Chapter 6}

\paragraph{? page 59 Figure 6.2:} The men does not look like a stone.

\paragraph{? page 60 Figure 6.3:} Better to reflect (a) and (c) so it will have the same orientation as (b).

\paragraph{! page 65 Figure 6.5:} The second bike from the left leans to wrong side.

\paragraph{? page 64 sec 6.5, line 12:} Add a footnote after ``counterturn.'':

``This may depend on your bicycle riding style. Try turning by moving only the handlebars, not your body.''

\paragraph{? page 65 line $\bm{(-2)}$:} I would add footnote ``The same reason as in 6.2''.

\paragraph{? page 66 line 7--8:} You are cheating here. I would write the following:

``Cancelling $m$, we obtain
\[
V^2 - v^2 = 2gh,
\]
and after a few algebraic manipulations,
\[
V - v = \frac{2gh}{v+V} = \frac{2gh}{v+\sqrt{2gh+v^2}}.
\]
In particular, as the initial velocity $v$ increases, its increment $V - v$ decreases.''

\paragraph{? page 72 sec 6.11, line 1:} ``top.'' $>\!>\!>$  ``top (Figure 6.2).''

\paragraph{! page 75 Figure 6.9:} Change $v$ to $V$ once and $v_1$ to $V_1$ twice.

\paragraph{? page 76 line 8:} $\Delta K$ $>\!>\!>$ $\Delta K_{\mathrm{total}}$.

\subsection*{Chapter 7}

\paragraph{! page 79 sec 7.2 line 9 in Answer:}
``$F_{\mathrm{coriolis}}\approx 240$ g'' $>\!>\!>$
\\
``$F_{\mathrm{coriolis}}/g\approx 240$ g'' or better ``$F_{\mathrm{coriolis}}/g\approx .24$ kg'' (so $g\ne$ g)

\paragraph{? page 79 sec 7.2 line 11 in Answer:} Do you want to move ``This force can hold up a cup of water!'' to the previous par?

\paragraph{! page 79 line $\bm{(-3)}$:} Instead of $1/600$ it should be $1/300$ and $0{.}1$° should be $0{.}2$° and 10 cm as well... (But maybe I am mad.)

\subsection*{Chapter 8}

\paragraph{? page 86 line $\bm{(-4)}$:} ``The velocity shown in Figure 8.1 is wrong'' --- the picture correctly shows tangential component of velocity.

\paragraph{! page 87 Figure 8.2:} $v\omega\Delta t\cos(\omega t)$ $>\!>\!>$ $v\omega\Delta t\cos(\omega \Delta t)$.

\paragraph{? page 87 Figure 8.2:} Formally speaking, the picture shows two terms of the normal part of $\Delta v$, which is not $\Delta v$.

\paragraph{? page 88 line 18 (right above Question):} ``in (b)'' $>\!>\!>$ ``in Figure 8.3b''

\paragraph{! page 95 line 1:} ``nonzero'' $>\!>\!>$ ``acute''.

\paragraph{? page 95 line 5:} ``$a$'' $>\!>\!>$ ``$a_{\mathrm{tan}}$''.

\paragraph{? page 95 line 13:} ``$a=a_c$'' $>\!>\!>$ ``$a_{\mathrm{tan}}=a_{\mathrm{central}}$'' and further\\
``$a_c$'' $>\!>\!>$ ``$a_{\mathrm{central}}$''. (It is more consistent with the other notations.)

\paragraph{! page 100 line 12:} ``... and $r$ ...'' $>\!>\!>$ ``..., $u$ is the velocity of the center of mass, and $r$ ...''

\paragraph{! page 102 Figure 8.11:} ``$r(s)$'' $>\!>\!>$ ``$r(s,t)$''\\ and ``$r(s+ds)$'' $>\!>\!>$ ``$r(s+ds,t)$''.

\paragraph{? page 102 line $\bm{(-2)}$:} Do you want to change ``$ds$'' $>\!>\!>$ ``$\Delta s$''?
